Published papers
======
I have three published articles. All of them are in Russian. Considering that almost no one will read them, I briefly describe them in a few sentences.



[<span style="color:#007CBB">Формирование Ломбардного списка как искажающий сигнал Банка России (In Russian)</span>](http://olegtelegin.github.io/files/Oleg_Telegin_Lombard_List.pdf) (Lombard List formation as a distorting signal of the Bank of Russia) http://doi.org/10.32609/0042-8736-2022-10-37-65
> The Bank of Russia regularly updates the Lombard List, a list of assets that can be used as collateral to provide banks with liquidity. A small case study was inspired by the instant inclusion of Rosneft bonds in the Lombard List in 2014 and the ensuing market panic. If the Bank of Russia includes bonds faster than three weeks after issuance (11 cases in 7 years), markets perceive this as positive news about the company; the cumulative effect is about 0.5%, but only for quick inclusions and with heterogeneous volatility effect across companies. Thus, the central bank unwillingly signals the state of affairs of private companies through its Lombard list operations. Reducing the discretion of these operations can remove the effect.




[<span style="color:#007CBB">Регулярные коммуникации Банка России и краткосрочные эффекты волатильности на финансовых рынках (In Russian)</span>](http://olegtelegin.github.io/files/Oleg_Telegin_CB_volatility.pdf) (Bank of Russia regular communications and volatility short-term effects in financial markets) http://doi.org/10.31737/2221-2264-2022-54-2-7
> A study of volatility on the meeting days of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. HAR models show fast market adjustment; volatility increases only for 15-20 minutes. Press conferences have almost no effect.




[<span style="color:#007CBB">Вербальные интервенции Банка России и структура процентных ставок (In Russian)</span>](http://olegtelegin.github.io/files/Telegin_Oleg_Verbal_Interventions.pdf)  (Verbal interventions of the Bank of Russia and the interest rate structure) (joint with Sergey Merzlyakov) http://doi.org/10.31063/2073-6517/2019.16-4.5
> Data from all informal communications of the Bank of Russia during the transition to inflation targeting regime with manually labeled topics and tones. The transition to inflation targeting enhances the zero coupon yield curve response to communications. Different topics affect different parts of the curve. This article has a small unpublished follow-up work in English (I will add it here soon). Markets are more likely to react to the Governor's communications than other Board members. For Deputy Governors, interest rates mainly respond to statements on issues that fall within the scope of their direct responsibilities at the Bank of Russia.
