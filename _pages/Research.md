[<span style="color:#007CBB">Always silent? Endogenous central bank communication during the quiet period</span>](http://olegtelegin.github.io/files/Oleg_Telegin_Quiet_Period.pdf) <br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:12px">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paper analyzes whether the central bank needs to always adhere to the quiet period policy. The financial market model describes a multivariate trade-off in which the central bank not only focuses on the instantaneous reaction of markets to a breach of the quiet period regime but also estimates both the effects of an upcoming Board meeting and changes in market volatility. Then, it sometimes becomes more appropriate for the central bank to intervene in financial markets during the quiet period. The main drivers of this communication are the willingness to pay attention to more than just the immediate consequences of the intervention and the allocation of uncertainty for market participants between the central bank's reaction function and the uncertainty associated with the dissent during the Board meeting itself. Such communication should take a collegial approach and may contain some interesting properties, such as response asymmetry - a central bank's less willingness to tell markets negative news about its assessment of the economic conditions. Resolution of uncertainty associated with such communications may also impact the current state of the quiet period with emerging leaks, individual breaches, and unattributed informal communications.

Published papers
======
I have three published articles. All of them are in Russian. Considering that almost no one can read them, I briefly describe them in a few sentences below.

<br>
<br>

[<span style="color:#007CBB">Формирование Ломбардного списка как искажающий сигнал Банка России (In Russian)</span>](http://olegtelegin.github.io/files/Oleg_Telegin_Lombard_List.pdf) (Lombard List formation as a distorting signal of the Bank of Russia) http://doi.org/10.32609/0042-8736-2022-10-37-65
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bank of Russia regularly updates the Lombard List, a list of assets that can be used as collateral to provide banks with liquidity. A small case study was inspired by the instant inclusion of Rosneft bonds in the Lombard List in 2014 and the ensuing market panic. If the Bank of Russia includes bonds faster than three weeks after issuance (11 cases in 7 years), markets perceive this as positive news about the company; the cumulative effect is about 0.5%, but only for quick inclusions and with heterogeneous volatility effect across companies. Thus, the central bank unwillingly signals the state of affairs of private companies through its Lombard list operations. Reducing the discretion of these operations can remove the effect.

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study of volatility on the meeting days of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. HAR models show fast market adjustment; volatility increases only for 15-20 minutes. Press conferences have almost no effect.

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data from all informal communications of the Bank of Russia during the transition to inflation targeting regime with manually labeled topics and tones. The transition to inflation targeting enhances the zero coupon yield curve response to communications. Different topics affect different parts of the curve. This article has a small unpublished follow-up work in English (I will add it here soon). Markets are more likely to react to the Governor's communications than other Board members. For Deputy Governors, interest rates mainly respond to statements on issues that fall within the scope of their direct responsibilities at the Bank of Russia.
