&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a PhD candidate at the Higher School of Economics under the supervision of Sergey Merzlyakov.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My specialization lies at the intersection of monetary and information economics, where I am currently exploring central bank communication from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, I served as a Lecturer in the Department of Theoretical Economics and as an Intern Researcher at the International Laboratory for Macroeconomic Analysis at HSE.
