&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a Research Assistant in Finance at INSEAD.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My research interests lie at the intersection of monetary and information economics. I am particularly interested in central bank communication, which I have studied from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Of course, this is currently an 'on-hold' part of my life - as a department RA, my focus tends to switch on a daily basis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, I worked as a Lecturer in the Department of Theoretical Economics and as an Intern Researcher at the International Laboratory for Macroeconomic Analysis at HSE University. I was also a PhD candidate at HSE University under the supervision of Sergey Merzlyakov.
